It's a piano, but with sheet music.
For people who want to learn how to read sheet music or play the piano, this (hopefully) can help you do both of those things at once!

Warning: To this project, everything will be treated as a whole note!

Inspired by this post on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50105166) and [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gschier/pen/VKgyaY) and wanted to get experience using VexFlow. Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 since that's the license that StackOverflow answers are under, and since like 99% of this project is not my work!

## TODO

- Add bass clef
- Add better timing?
- Fix it so when you play multiple notes, it doesn't have any weird behavior
